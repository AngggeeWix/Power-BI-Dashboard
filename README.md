Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm excited to showcase a project that demonstrates my proficiency in data visualization and business analytics using Power BI.

Project Overview:
I've created a dynamic and insightful sales dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and gain actionable insights.

1. Data Analysis and Preparation:
* Clean and transform the raw data using Power Query in Power BI.
* Calculate metrics such as profit, average rating, and sales distribution.
  
2. Data Visualization:
* Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
* Use different types of visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and tables to present the data effectively.

3. Dashboard Design:
* Design a clean and intuitive dashboard layout.
* Include filters and slicers to allow users to interact with the data dynamically.
* Organize the dashboard into sections for different metrics.
* Add titles, subtitles, and descriptions to provide context for the data.
